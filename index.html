        <p>I am Cristhina Chacón, a 35-year-old software development student from Venezuela, currently living in Peru. I am a determined and creative person who loves to challenge myself and excel in everything I do. I am passionate about learning and self-improvement, which is why I’m pursuing a career in programming and always seeking opportunities to grow. My faith as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints plays a central role in my life, giving me strength and purpose. In my free time, I enjoy being with my family, exploring new skills, and adding a touch of humor and creativity to my daily activities. My journey has taught me the value of resilience and optimism, and I strive to inspire others through my hard work and dedication.</p>

        <h2>Caracas - Venezuela</h2>
        <img src="./images/caracas3.jpg" alt="Caracas">
        <p>Caracas is the capital of Venezuela and the city where I grew up. It's surrounded by beautiful mountains, especially the Ávila, which is like a natural treasure for everyone who lives there. Caracas is full of life, with busy streets, warm people, and a mix of modern buildings and historical places. It’s a place that holds many memories for me, from its parks to its delicious food and vibrant culture.</p>
